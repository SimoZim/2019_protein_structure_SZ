	WP32:	calculation of frequencies:
				How to calculate the relative frequencies?
				Are there formulas available which are working?
			time/duration: 1 - 2 h
	
	WP33:	generation of a logical/readable table:
				How to summarize the results in a good overview?
				How should the table look like?
				Which file-format is necessary to save the table?
			time/duration: 0.5 - 1 h

-----------------------------------------------------------------------			

MS4: visualisation of the table of MS3
	 /required steps: WP41, WP42
	 /responsibility: executing person
	 /time/duration: 2 - 5 h
	 /proof of MS4: plot
	 
	WP41:	literature research:
	 			Is it possible to plot it with Biopython?

	WP42:	generation of a plot:
				How to generate a self-explanatory plot?
				How to label the axis and legends?
				How to save the plot?
			time/duration: 1 - 3 h

-----------------------------------------------------------------------				

MS5: validation of the results
	 /required steps: WP51, WP52
	 /responsibility: executing person
	 /time/duration: 3.5 - 4.5 h
	 /proof of MS5: approval of the results

	WP51:	control of the workflow of the project:
				Was each step performed without errors?
				Was the execution of MS1 - MS4 possible?
				Was the execution of MS1 - MS4 exact?
			time/duration: 0.5 - 1.5 h
			
	WP52:	control of the results:
				Are the results plausible?
				Which amino-acids usually lead to alpha-helix or beta-sheet?
				Which literature and databases could be taken for comparison?
			time/duration: 3 - 4 h
			
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

MS6: close of the project
	 /required steps: WP61, WP62
	 /responsibility: executing person
	 /time/duration: 2.5 - 6 h
	 /proof of MS6: report/presentation of the project
	 
	 WP61:	control if MS5 is finished:
				Is the approval of the results available?
			time/duration: 0.5 - 1 h
	
	WP62:	writing a report or/and presentation:
				How to summarize the results of the whole project?
				How to interpret the results?
				How to write in an understandable form?
